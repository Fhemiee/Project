# Project
Warehouse Process Optimization Using Agile Methodologies
Objective: To enhance order fulfillment speed, reduce errors, and improve overall efficiency.

Solutions Implemented:

Agile Methodologies: Transitioned to Agile with sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives to improve flexibility and collaboration.
Lean Principles: I would apply value stream mapping and 5S implementation to eliminate waste and streamline processes.
Data-Driven Decision Making: Used JMP Pro for statistical analysis, control charts, and time series forecasting to monitor and improve processes.
Training and Education: I Would provid Agile and Lean training to team members to ensure a smooth transition and continuous improvement.
Results:

Order Processing Time: Reduced from 5 days to 3.6 days.
Error Rate: Decreased from 4% to 2.3%.
Inventory Accuracy: Increased from 95% to 98%.
Pick and Pack Time: Reduced from 20 minutes to 14 minutes.
Using JMP Pro, I analyzed performance data and visualized the impact of the changes. Below are some insights:

1. Bivariate Fit of Order Processing Time (days) By Week 

Correlation (-0.93955): 
Explanation: Correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. A correlation of -0.93955 indicates a strong negative relationship between weeks and order processing time. As the weeks increase, the order processing time decreases significantly. 
The negative correlation of -0.94 shows that as time progresses, the order processing time has decreased significantly, indicating that the process improvements are having a “positive effect." 
Significance Probability (<.0001): 
The p-value indicates the probability that the observed correlation is due to random chance. A very low p-value (<0.0001) means the result is statistically significant and highly unlikely to be due to chance. 
Detail: The p-value is less than 0.0001, which means the reduction in order processing time is statistically significant and not due to random variation. 

2. Bivariate Fit of Error Rate (%) By Week 

Correlation (-0.96504): 
Explanation: A correlation of -0.96504 indicates a very strong negative relationship between week and error rate. As the weeks increase, the error rate decreases significantly. 
The strong negative correlation of -0.97 shows the error rates have consistently decreased over time, demonstrating the effectiveness of our quality improvement measures. 
Significance Probability (<.0001): 
A very low p-value (<0.0001) indicates that the observed reduction in error rate is statistically significant and not due to random chance. 
Detail: With a p-value of less than 0.0001, the decrease in error rate is statistically significant and not just a random fluctuation.
